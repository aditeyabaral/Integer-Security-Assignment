# Integer-Security-Assignment-UE19CS257C
A C project made as a part of the Secure Programming with C course (UE18CS257C) course at PES University. The objective of the project was to display the effects of integer overflows in the C programming language the necessary steps required to prevent such errors in product development.

*Created and tested on Linux Environment* :)

# Compilation and Execution
To compile and run the file with vulnerabilities: 

```gcc Main.c Dependencies-vulnerability.c```

To run the secure file: 

```gcc Main.c Dependencies-secure.c```

Finally, execute the outfile using ```./a.out```

*A database file is created upon first run and all user credentials are stored in this file. This database is loaded into memory on subsequent runs*
